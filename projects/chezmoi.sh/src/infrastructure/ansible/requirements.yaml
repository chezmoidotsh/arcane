# Ansible requirements for TrueNAS Scale management
#
# Local Collection Configuration:
#   The chezmoidotsh.truenas_scale collection is located locally in:
#   catalog/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/chezmoidotsh/truenas_scale/
#
# To use the collection, ensure ansible.cfg contains:
#   [defaults]
#   collections_paths = ./catalog/ansible/collections
#
# No external collection installation required - everything is self-contained.

collections:
  # Local TrueNAS Scale collection for managing TrueNAS Scale systems
  # Fork adapted specifically for TrueNAS Scale with midclt-only communication
  # Location: catalog/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/chezmoidotsh/truenas_scale/
  # Namespace: chezmoidotsh.truenas_scale
  #
  # Note: This replaces the external arensb.truenas collection with a
  # focused, Scale-compatible fork that provides better control and reliability
  # for critical infrastructure management.
  #
  # No installation command needed - collection is part of the repository.
