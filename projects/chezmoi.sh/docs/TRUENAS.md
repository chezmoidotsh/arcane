# TrueNAS (`nas.chezmoi.sh`)

`nas.chezmoi.sh` is the home NAS: bulk media storage for players on the LAN,
self-hosted application data (Immich, Paperless, Silverbullet, Garage, and the
reverse proxy in front of them), personal and shared documents, and backup
targets for Home Assistant and Time Machine. It runs two ZFS pools -- `zp1cs01`
on spinning disks for media, and `zp1hs01` on SSDs for everything that
benefits from lower latency (applications, documents, backups) -- with an
off-site copy of the SSD pool pushed to Backblaze B2.

## How it's managed

`nas.chezmoi.sh` (TrueNAS SCALE) is managed as code via the `chezmoi-sh-infra`
Pulumi stack (state in a self-hosted Garage S3 backend). Provider credentials
come from stack config (`truenas:url`), set via `pulumi config set --secret`
-- never hardcoded in source.

## Network & services

`nas.chezmoi.sh` sits behind gateway `10.0.0.1` and resolves
DNS through 10.0.0.1 and 9.9.9.9. Its physical interfaces:
`ens18` at `10.0.0.30/22`, `10.0.0.31/22` (MTU 1500); `ens27` at `172.31.255.253/30` (MTU 1500).

The NAS exposes only the protocols it needs: cifs, nfs and ssh
are enabled; ftp, iscsitarget, snmp and ups stay off.

## Pools, disks & datasets

Each pool below is a set of mirrored or RAIDZ disk groups (vdevs) that TrueNAS
already manages physically -- Pulumi never creates or resizes a pool, it only
manages the ZFS datasets carved out of it. The diagram under each pool name is
its live vdev/disk layout, fetched straight from the NAS rather than declared
anywhere in code; the tree under that lists every dataset Pulumi manages in
that pool, with its quota, encryption and purpose where relevant.

## Shares

NFS is used where a client needs Unix-style permission mapping (media consumers,
Paperless); SMB covers everything else (Windows/macOS clients, application
storage, Time Machine).

### NFS

- `nfs-share-animes` (Animés (Jellyfin)) --
  read-only, mapped to `nobody`
- `nfs-share-movies` (Films (Jellyfin)) --
  read-only, mapped to `nobody`
- `nfs-share-musics` (Musiques (Jellyfin)) --
  read-only, mapped to `nobody`
- `nfs-share-tvshows` (Séries TV (Jellyfin)) --
  read-only, mapped to `nobody`
- `nfs-share-documents-alexandre-admin` (Documents personnels d'alexandre (Paperless)) --
  read/write, mapped to `paperless-ngx`

### SMB

Each share below applies one of TrueNAS's presets: `DEFAULT_SHARE` is the
general-purpose preset, `LEGACY_SHARE` skips presets entirely (options are
set manually, not a sign the share is deprecated), `PRIVATE_DATASETS_SHARE`
is meant for one dataset per user, and `TIMEMACHINE_SHARE` enables the SMB
extensions macOS Time Machine needs.

- `smb-share-films` (Accès aux films de la médiathèque) -- LEGACY_SHARE
- `smb-share-animes` (Accès aux animés de la médiathèque) -- LEGACY_SHARE
- `smb-share-series-tv` (Accès aux séries TV/streaming de la médiathèque) -- LEGACY_SHARE
- `smb-share-livres` (Accès aux livres de la médiathèque) -- DEFAULT_SHARE
- `smb-share-musique` (Accès aux musiques de la médiathèque) -- DEFAULT_SHARE
- `smb-share-mes-documents` (Documents personnels) -- PRIVATE_DATASETS_SHARE
- `smb-share-shared-documents` (Documents partagés) -- LEGACY_SHARE
- `smb-share-hass-chezmoi-sh` (Sauvegardes Home Assistant) -- DEFAULT_SHARE
- `smb-share-application-immich` (Stockage applicatif Immich (Kubernetes)) -- LEGACY_SHARE
- `smb-share-application-paperless` (Stockage applicatif Paperless-ngx (Kubernetes)) -- LEGACY_SHARE

## Permissions

> [!WARNING]
> This stack cannot apply filesystem ACLs to a dataset -- `truenas.FilesystemAcl`
> only works for POSIX1E through this provider; NFS4 entries built from its
> schema are rejected outright by the NAS's own API. It manages the NFS4 ACL
> *templates* below instead (named presets, visible in the TrueNAS UI's ACL
> editor) and documents which one to apply, by hand, to which dataset. Datasets
> not listed in the assignment table keep whatever ACL is already set on the
> NAS -- Pulumi doesn't manage them.

### Identities

| Username | UID | GID | SMB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `home-assistant` | 30001 | 137 | yes |
| `immich` | 30002 | 136 | yes |
| `paperless` | 30003 | 138 | yes |

### NFS4 ACL templates

| Name | ACL type | Grants |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NFSV4_MANAGED_APPLICATION` | NFS4 | Owner gets read+write, nobody else has any access. For service accounts this stack manages itself (Home Assistant, Immich, Paperless-ngx), as opposed to TrueNAS&#x27;s own Apps feature. |
| `NFSV4_TRUENAS_APPLICATION` | NFS4 | Only TrueNAS&#x27;s own &#x60;apps&#x60; service account gets read+write. For datasets backing TrueNAS&#x27;s native Apps feature, not applications this stack manages itself. |
| `NFSV4_SMB_ALL` | NFS4 | Every local SMB account (TrueNAS&#x27;s built-in &#x60;builtin_users&#x60; group) gets read+write. For datasets with no single dedicated owner. |
| `NFSV4_SMB_VIEWER` | NFS4 | Owner gets read+write; every other local SMB account (&#x60;builtin_users&#x60;) gets read-only. |

### Dataset -> template assignment

> [!NOTE]
> **Why not manage ACLs directly via Pulumi?**
>
> Because the used TrueNAS TF provider doesn't support handle NFS4 ACLs
> properly, this stack cannot apply ACLs to datasets. Instead, it manages the
> templates (named presets) and documents which one to apply to which dataset.

Apply the matching template to each dataset below via the TrueNAS UI's ACL
editor (Storage -> Datasets -> select dataset -> Edit Permissions -> select
ACL Type: NFSv4 -> Use ACL Preset).

| Dataset | Template to apply |
| --- | --- |
| `zp1cs01/media` | `NFSV4_SMB_ALL` |
| `zp1hs01/userspace/shared` | `NFSV4_SMB_ALL` |
| `zp1hs01/backups/hass.chezmoi.sh` | `NFSV4_MANAGED_APPLICATION` |
| `zp1hs01/applications/managed/app.immich` | `NFSV4_MANAGED_APPLICATION` |
| `zp1hs01/applications/managed/com.paperless-ngx` | `NFSV4_MANAGED_APPLICATION` |
## Backups

Off-site copies go to Backblaze B2, split across private,
file lock-protected buckets (immutable for the retention window below, with
older versions pruned after the lifecycle window):

- `nas-backup-50a30f2b` -- 7-day file lock retention, 60-day
  lifecycle prune.
- `nas-backup-4e6b1351` -- 7-day file lock retention, 60-day
  lifecycle prune.

### What's synced, and how often

- B2 — Daily sync of users' spaces (shared excluded): `/mnt/zp1hs01/userspace`,
  daily at 01:00,
  PUSH/SYNC
- B2 — Weekly sync of immich.app application: `/mnt/zp1hs01/applications/managed/app.immich`,
  weekly, Sundays at 02:00,
  PUSH/SYNC
- B2 — Weekly sync of paperless-ngx.com application: `/mnt/zp1hs01/applications/managed/com.paperless-ngx`,
  weekly, Sundays at 02:00,
  PUSH/SYNC
- B2 — Weekly sync of TrueNAS applications: `/mnt/zp1hs01/applications/truenas`,
  weekly, Sundays at 02:00,
  PUSH/SYNC
- Before these existed, a legacy global sync of `/mnt/zp1hs01`
  pushed the whole pool
  weekly, Sundays at 02:00,
  PUSH/SYNC
  -- kept for reference only.

zp1cs01 isn't included in this off-site sync.
## Security notes

A few things worth knowing about what this configuration does and doesn't
protect against:

- **Share IP restrictions live entirely on the NAS, not in Pulumi.** Neither
  NFS's `hosts` allowlist (no Kerberos, so this is the only access control
  those shares have) nor SMB's `hostsallow`/`auxsmbconf` are managed here --
  the SMB ones aren't in this provider's schema at all, and NFS's are
  deliberately left alone to match. Whatever's configured directly on the NAS
  is the only source of truth; Pulumi can't detect or revert changes to it.
- **NFS has no per-person access control.** Every NFS share maps all
  connecting clients to one fixed identity (`mapallUser`/`mapallGroup`), so
  RO/RW differentiation only ever happens per-share, never per-person. Where
  per-person access actually matters, the Permissions section above uses SMB
  instead, backed by a real account.
- **Filesystem ACLs are never applied automatically.** The NFS4 ACL
  templates and dataset assignments in the Permissions section above are a
  guide for a human, not something this stack enforces -- `truenas.FilesystemAcl`
  cannot express NFS4 entries through this provider (confirmed against the
  live API), and the templates it *can* manage have no way to be applied to
  a path except by hand, in the TrueNAS UI. Nothing detects or reverts a
  dataset whose actual ACL has drifted from its documented assignment.
