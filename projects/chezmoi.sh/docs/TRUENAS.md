`nas.chezmoi.sh` is the household NAS. Its sole role is **data storage**: the
media library (films, series, anime, music, books), personal documents and home
archives, data volumes for select self-hosted applications (Immich,
Paperless-ngx, Silverbullet), and backup targets — including database dumps
pushed to S3.

The only service it runs beyond plain file storage is
[Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/), an S3-compatible object store —
TrueNAS SCALE has no native S3, so Garage fills that gap, but it stays in the
data-serving domain, not application hosting.

It runs as a TrueNAS SCALE virtual machine on Proxmox, with
2 ZFS pools detailed
in the section below, plus an off-site copy of the data pushed to Backblaze B2.

## How it's managed

`nas.chezmoi.sh` (TrueNAS SCALE) is managed as code via the
[`chezmoi-sh-infra`](../src/infrastructure/pulumi/) Pulumi stack.

```sh
mise run pulumi:diff              # preview pending changes
mise run pulumi:apply             # apply changes (regenerates this doc automatically)
mise run truenas:docs:generate    # regenerate this document only
```

Any change to the NAS (datasets, shares, users, snapshots, …) is declared in
the stack above and applied through Pulumi. Applying the stack also regenerates
this document — there is normally no reason to run the generator by hand.

## Network & services

`nas.chezmoi.sh` sits behind gateway `10.0.0.1` and resolves
DNS through 10.0.0.1 and 9.9.9.9. Its physical interfaces:
- `ens18` at `10.0.0.30/22`, `10.0.0.31/22` _(MTU 1500)_
- `ens27` at `172.31.255.253/30` _(MTU 1500)_

The NAS exposes only the protocols it needs: cifs, nfs and ssh
are enabled; ftp, iscsitarget, snmp and ups stay off.

## Pools, disks & datasets

Each pool below is a set of mirrored or RAIDZ disk groups (vdevs) that TrueNAS
already manages physically -- Pulumi never creates or resizes a pool, it only
manages the ZFS datasets carved out of it. The diagram under each pool name is
its live vdev/disk layout, fetched straight from the NAS rather than declared
anywhere in code; the tree under that lists every dataset Pulumi manages in
that pool, with its quota, encryption and purpose where relevant.

## Shares

SMB is the only share protocol in use right now -- covering Windows/macOS
clients, application storage, and Time Machine.

### SMB

> [!NOTE]
> Each share applies one of TrueNAS's presets:
>
> - **`DEFAULT_SHARE`** — the general-purpose preset.
> - **`LEGACY_SHARE`** — skips presets entirely (options are set manually, not a sign the share is deprecated).
> - **`PRIVATE_DATASETS_SHARE`** — meant for one dataset per user.
> - **`TIMEMACHINE_SHARE`** — enables the SMB extensions macOS Time Machine needs.

- `smb-share-animes` (Accès aux animés de la médiathèque) — **LEGACY_SHARE**
- `smb-share-application-immich` (Stockage applicatif Immich (Kubernetes)) — **LEGACY_SHARE**
- `smb-share-application-paperless` (Stockage applicatif Paperless-ngx (Kubernetes)) — **LEGACY_SHARE**
- `smb-share-films` (Accès aux films de la médiathèque) — **LEGACY_SHARE**
- `smb-share-hass-chezmoi-sh` (Sauvegardes Home Assistant) — **DEFAULT_SHARE**
- `smb-share-livres` (Accès aux livres de la médiathèque) — **DEFAULT_SHARE**
- `smb-share-mes-documents` (Documents personnels) — **PRIVATE_DATASETS_SHARE**
- `smb-share-musique` (Accès aux musiques de la médiathèque) — **DEFAULT_SHARE**
- `smb-share-series-tv` (Accès aux séries TV/streaming de la médiathèque) — **LEGACY_SHARE**
- `smb-share-shared-documents` (Documents partagés) — **LEGACY_SHARE**

## Permissions

> [!WARNING]
> This stack cannot apply filesystem ACLs to a dataset -- `truenas.FilesystemAcl`
> only works for POSIX1E through this provider; NFS4 entries built from its
> schema are rejected outright by the NAS's own API. It manages the NFS4 ACL
> *templates* below instead (named presets, visible in the TrueNAS UI's ACL
> editor) and documents which one to apply, by hand, to which dataset. Datasets
> not listed in the assignment table keep whatever ACL is already set on the
> NAS -- Pulumi doesn't manage them.

### Identities

<div align="center">

| Username | UID | GID | SMB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `firesticktv` | 3000 | 140 | yes |
| `home-assistant` | 30001 | 137 | yes |
| `immich` | 30002 | 136 | yes |
| `jellyfin` | 30004 | 141 | yes |
| `paperless` | 30003 | 138 | yes |

</div>

### NFS4 ACL templates

<div align="center">

| Name | ACL type | Grants |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NFSV4_MANAGED_APPLICATION` | NFS4 | Owner gets read+write, nobody else has any access. For service accounts this stack manages itself (Home Assistant, Immich, Paperless-ngx), as opposed to TrueNAS's own Apps feature. |
| `NFSV4_SMB_ALL` | NFS4 | Every local SMB account (TrueNAS's built-in `builtin_users` group) gets read+write. For datasets with no single dedicated owner. |
| `NFSV4_SMB_MEDIA` | NFS4 | Like NFSV4_SMB_ALL (every local SMB account gets read+write), except FireStickTV and Jellyfin are pinned to read-only -- both only ever consume the media library, never write to it. |
| `NFSV4_SMB_VIEWER` | NFS4 | Owner gets read+write; every other local SMB account (`builtin_users`) gets read-only. |
| `NFSV4_TRUENAS_APPLICATION` | NFS4 | Only TrueNAS's own `apps` service account gets read+write. For datasets backing TrueNAS's native Apps feature, not applications this stack manages itself. |

</div>

### Dataset → template assignment

> [!NOTE]
> **Why not manage ACLs directly via Pulumi?**
>
> Because the used TrueNAS TF provider doesn't support handle NFS4 ACLs
> properly, this stack cannot apply ACLs to datasets. Instead, it manages the
> templates (named presets) and documents which one to apply to which dataset.

Apply the matching template to each dataset below via the TrueNAS UI's ACL
editor: `Storage` → `Datasets` → select the dataset → `Edit Permissions` →
set `ACL Type` to `NFSv4` → `Use ACL Preset`.

<div align="center">

| Dataset | Template to apply |
| --- | --- |
| `zp1cs01/media` | `NFSV4_SMB_MEDIA` |
| `zp1hs01/userspace/shared` | `NFSV4_SMB_ALL` |
| `zp1hs01/backups/hass.chezmoi.sh` | `NFSV4_MANAGED_APPLICATION` |
| `zp1hs01/applications/managed/app.immich` | `NFSV4_MANAGED_APPLICATION` |
| `zp1hs01/applications/managed/com.paperless-ngx` | `NFSV4_MANAGED_APPLICATION` |

</div>
## Backups

`nas.chezmoi.sh` protects its data through three independent layers, each
covering a different failure mode: bitrot (Layer 1), accidental deletion
(Layer 2), and total site loss (Layer 3).

### Layer 1: Bitrot detection (scrubbing)

A scrub reads every block stored in a pool and verifies its checksum against
ZFS's own metadata, repairing corruption automatically when the pool has
redundancy (mirror or RAID-Z). It's the first, local line of defense against
silent disk decay.

- **Each Sunday at 00:00**:
  scrub `zp1cs01` (35-day alert threshold)
- **Each Sunday at 00:00**:
  scrub `zp1hs01` (35-day alert threshold)

### Layer 2: Accidental-deletion protection (snapshots)

A snapshot is an instant, read-only, point-in-time copy of a dataset,
consuming disk space only for data that changes after it's taken. It
protects against an accidentally deleted or overwritten file -- not against
losing the NAS itself.

- **Each Sunday at 03:00**:
  recursive snapshot of `zp1hs01` (whole pool),
  4-week retention
- **Each day at 00:00**:
  snapshot of `zp1hs01/applications/managed/app.immich`,
  8-day retention
- **Each day at 00:00**:
  snapshot of `zp1hs01/applications/managed/com.paperless-ngx`,
  8-day retention

### Layer 3: Site-loss protection (remote sync)

Selected datasets are pushed off-site to Backblaze B2, split
across private, file lock-protected buckets (immutable for the retention
window below, with older versions pruned after the lifecycle window):

#### Where are the backups stored
- `nas-backup-4e6b1351` -- 7-day file lock retention, 60-day
  lifecycle prune.
- `nas-backup-50a30f2b` -- 7-day file lock retention, 60-day
  lifecycle prune.


#### What is backed up and when
- **Each Sunday at 02:00**:
  B2 — Weekly sync of immich.app application on `/mnt/zp1hs01/applications/managed/app.immich` (PUSH & SYNC)
- **Each Sunday at 02:00**:
  B2 — Weekly sync of paperless-ngx.com application on `/mnt/zp1hs01/applications/managed/com.paperless-ngx` (PUSH & SYNC)
- **Each day at 01:00**:
  B2 — Weekly sync of TrueNAS applications on `/mnt/zp1hs01/applications/truenas` (PUSH & SYNC)
- **Each day at 01:00**:
  B2 — Daily sync of users' spaces (shared excluded) on `/mnt/zp1hs01/userspace` (PUSH & SYNC)
- **Each Sunday at 02:00**:
  legacy whole-pool sync of `/mnt/zp1hs01`
  (PUSH & SYNC) --
  kept for reference only

zp1cs01 isn't included in this off-site sync.

## Security notes

A few things worth knowing about what this configuration does and doesn't
protect against:

- **Share IP restrictions live entirely on the NAS, not in Pulumi.** Neither
  NFS's `hosts` allowlist (no Kerberos, so this is the only access control
  those shares have) nor SMB's `hostsallow`/`auxsmbconf` are managed here --
  the SMB ones aren't in this provider's schema at all, and NFS's are
  deliberately left alone to match. Whatever's configured directly on the NAS
  is the only source of truth; Pulumi can't detect or revert changes to it.
- **NFS has no per-person access control.** Every NFS share maps all
  connecting clients to one fixed identity (`mapallUser`/`mapallGroup`), so
  RO/RW differentiation only ever happens per-share, never per-person. Where
  per-person access actually matters, the Permissions section above uses SMB
  instead, backed by a real account.
- **Filesystem ACLs are never applied automatically.** The NFS4 ACL
  templates and dataset assignments in the Permissions section above are a
  guide for a human, not something this stack enforces -- `truenas.FilesystemAcl`
  cannot express NFS4 entries through this provider (confirmed against the
  live API), and the templates it *can* manage have no way to be applied to
  a path except by hand, in the TrueNAS UI. Nothing detects or reverts a
  dataset whose actual ACL has drifted from its documented assignment.
