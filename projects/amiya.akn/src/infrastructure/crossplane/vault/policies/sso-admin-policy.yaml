      # This policy defines administrative permissions for Vault operators with full access to common operational tasks such 
      # as managing secrets engines, authentication methods, identities, audit logs, and ACL policies â€” while explicitly denying
      # access to critical operations like sealing, replication control, rekeying, and root token handling.
      #
      # WARNING: This policy is intended for privileged users who should be able to manage most aspects of Vault without the
      #          risk of affecting core availability or security boundaries.
