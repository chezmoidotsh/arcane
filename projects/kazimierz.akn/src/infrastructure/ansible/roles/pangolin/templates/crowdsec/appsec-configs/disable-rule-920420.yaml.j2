# CrowdSec AppSec Configuration - Disable Rule 920420 for Pangolin Host
# Managed by Ansible - DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY
#
# Purpose:
#   Disable CrowdSec OWASP CRS native rule 920420 specifically for requests
#   to the Pangolin host ({{ pangolin_domains.domain1.base_domain }}) to allow
#   request content types that may not be in the default policy.
#
# Rule 920420 Description:
#   Part of REQUEST-920-PROTOCOL-ENFORCEMENT.conf from OWASP ModSecurity CRS
#
#   This rule validates that the Content-Type header of incoming requests
#   matches the allowed content types defined in the tx.allowed_request_content_type
#   variable. It works in two stages:
#
#   1. Extracts the mime-type portion from Content-Type header (before semicolon)
#      Example: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -> "application/json"
#
#   2. Checks if the extracted mime-type is within the allowed list
#      If not allowed, triggers CRITICAL severity alert and blocks the request
#
#   Default allowed types are defined in crs-setup.conf (rule 900220)
#
#   This protection helps prevent vulnerabilities like Apache Struts
#   Content-Type arbitrary command execution (CVE-2017-5638).
#
# Why Disable for Pangolin:
#   The rule may cause false positives when legitimate applications send
#   non-standard or custom Content-Type headers that are not in the default
#   allowed list, preventing normal operations of the Pangolin dashboard.
#
# Scope:
#   This rule is ONLY disabled for requests to {{ pangolin_domains.domain1.base_domain }}.
#   All other hosts behind CrowdSec will continue to have this protection active.
#
# Security Consideration:
#   Disabling this rule for {{ pangolin_domains.domain1.base_domain }} reduces
#   protection against Content-Type based attacks on that specific host. Ensure that:
#   - Application-level validation of Content-Type is implemented in Pangolin
#   - Only trusted sources can send requests to Pangolin
#   - Other hosts remain protected by this rule
#
# Implementation:
#   Uses the pre_eval hook with a host-based filter (req.Host) to selectively
#   disable the rule only for requests targeting {{ pangolin_domains.domain1.base_domain }}
#   during in-band processing. The rule remains active for all other hosts.
