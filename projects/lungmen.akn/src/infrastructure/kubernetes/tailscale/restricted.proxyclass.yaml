# To adhere to security best practices, most clusters are configured with Admission
# Controllers in "restricted" mode.
# However, the Tailscale Operator requires modifying the pods' Security Context.
# Thus, it is essential to create a ProxyClass with the appropriate configurations to
# allow the operator to manage these Security Contexts.
