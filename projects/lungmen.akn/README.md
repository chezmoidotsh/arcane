> \[!NOTE]
> **Why Lungmen?** In Arknights lore, Lungmen (ÈæôÈó®) is a prosperous city-state known for its advanced infrastructure, sophisticated urban services, and technological innovation. Just like the fictional city provides comprehensive services to its citizens, this platform delivers all essential home services through modern infrastructure and automation.

## About

Lungmen is a personal self-hosted platform for home services, designed to provide a complete ecosystem for media management, life organization, and automation. The platform runs on a Kubernetes cluster and is accessible through both local network and VPN, allowing secure access to services from anywhere while maintaining control over data and infrastructure.

## Architecture

## How to use / How to develop on it

This project uses [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) for GitOps-based deployment and [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) for configuration management. Here's how to work with it:

## Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

The recovery process is largely automated through the `amiya.akn` project, which hosts ArgoCD and automatically bootstraps any Kubernetes clusters it detects.

### Recovering process

> \[!NOTE]
> If the system cannot be managed using Talosctl, reboot on a live CD

1. **Reset/Reinstall Talos OS**:

   See [Talos Recovery](https://www.talos.dev/v1.10/advanced/disaster-recovery/) for more information about recovering from a Talos cluster and the [Talos Bootstrap documentation](docs/BOOTSTRAP_TALOS.md) for more information about bootstrapping the cluster.

2. **Link to ArgoCD**:

   > \[!NOTE]
   > This is only required if the cluster is not already linked to ArgoCD or if the cluster has been reset.\
   > You also need to have the context `admin@amiya.akn` in your kubeconfig.

   Because this project is designed to be runned in the same "network" as the `amiya.akn` project, we must link the cluster manually to ArgoCD.

   ```bash
   argocd --kube-context admin@akiya.akn cluster add admin@lungmen.akn --name lungmen.akn --label device.tailscale.com/os=linux
   ```

3. **Automatic Detection** - Once the cluster joins the Tailscale mesh, `amiya.akn` detects it automatically

### Manual Verification

* Check cluster status: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
* Verify Tailscale connectivity: `tailscale status`
* Confirm ArgoCD sync status in the `amiya.akn` console

> The entire platform is designed for zero-touch recovery once Tailscale is configured.
