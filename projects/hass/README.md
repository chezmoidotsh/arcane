## ℹ️ About

Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform that focuses on privacy and local control. It allows you to control all your devices from a single, mobile-friendly interface.

I personally use Home Assistant to get insights into my home's states like temperature, humidity, and energy consumption, rather than using it for purely automation purposes.
