## Context & Problem Statement

### Homelab External Access Challenge

This proof of concept validates **Option 5** from [ADR-006: Homelab External Access Strategy](../../decisions/006-homelab-sso-external-access-strategy.md), specifically testing the **Cloudflare Tunnel with CrowdSec Worker** approach for secure external service exposure.

The homelab infrastructure requires external access for various service categories while maintaining strict security and privacy requirements:

* **Authentication Services**: External OIDC flows and user authentication (primary use case: Authelia)
* **Application Services**: Self-hosted applications requiring external connectivity
* **API Endpoints**: Webhooks, integrations, and automation triggers

### Requirements Validation

This POC aims to validate whether the Cloudflare Tunnel + CrowdSec Worker architecture can meet the following requirements:

| Requirement               | Description                                           | POC Validation Method             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Security First**        | No third-party TLS termination for HTTP/HTTPS traffic | Test certificate chain validation |
| **Privacy Protection**    | Hide homelab public IP from external exposure         | Verify origin IP masking          |
| **Abuse Mitigation**      | Robust protection against automated attacks           | Simulate attack patterns          |
| **Protocol Support**      | Handle both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP protocols              | Test multiple service types       |
| **Zero-Trust Principles** | Defense-in-depth security architecture                | Validate security layers          |

### Strategic Context

This POC represents a shift from the original **Option 2** (Tailscale Funnel + Traefik) due to Tailscale Funnel's limitation to HTTP/HTTPS traffic only. The new architecture eliminates Traefik dependency while providing comprehensive protocol support and edge-based threat protection.

#### CrowdSec Account Setup

1. **Create CrowdSec Account**: Register at [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/)
2. **Generate Enrollment Key**: Navigate to Security Engines → Add Security Engine → Generate enrollment key
3. **Configure Enrollment Key**: Add the key to your `.env` file as `CROWDSEC_ENROLL_KEY`

## Implementation Guide

This implementation follows a logical deployment sequence, building security layers progressively from base infrastructure to edge protection.

### Phase 1: Environment Initialization

#### Step 1.1: Create Development Cluster

```bash
k3d cluster create poc-cloudflare-tunnel-crowdsec \
  --port "8080:80@loadbalancer" \
  --port "8443:443@loadbalancer"
```

**Purpose**: Creates an isolated Kubernetes environment for POC testing with load balancer port mappings.

**Why This Step**: Establishes a clean, reproducible environment that won't interfere with existing Kubernetes configurations.

#### Step 1.2: Configure Traefik with Access Logs

Enable access logs on the default Traefik installation for CrowdSec monitoring:

```bash
# Configure Traefik to enable access logs
kubectl apply -n kube-system -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1
kind: HelmChartConfig
metadata:
  name: traefik
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  valuesContent: |-
    logs:
      access:
        enabled: true
        format: common
EOF
```

**Purpose**: Enables structured access logging in JSON format for CrowdSec to parse and analyze traffic patterns.

**Why This Step**: CrowdSec requires access to web server logs to detect malicious patterns and generate security decisions. Without proper logging, CrowdSec cannot analyze traffic behavior effectively.

#### Step 1.3: Verify Cluster Access

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

**Expected Output**: Cluster should show as running with single node in Ready state.

### Phase 2: Security Infrastructure Deployment

We begin by establishing the security foundation with CrowdSec, which will analyze traffic patterns and generate protection decisions that will later be enforced at the Cloudflare edge. This creates the core threat intelligence engine that drives the entire security architecture.

#### Step 2.1: Deploy CrowdSec Security Engine

```bash
kubectl kustomize --enable-helm ./kubernetes/crowdsec | kubectl apply -f -
```

This deploys the complete CrowdSec stack including the Local API (LAPI) for decision processing, agents for log analysis, and PostgreSQL for decision storage. The LAPI will serve as the central decision engine that communicates with both local agents and the Cloudflare Worker.

> [!NOTE]
> The CrowdSec configuration is specifically set for `containerd` runtime (K3s/K3d) and includes the necessary parsers:
> - `crowdsecurity/cri-logs`: Parses Kubernetes container log format (CRI)
> - `crowdsecurity/traefik-logs`: Extracts Traefik access logs from the parsed container logs
>
> This parsing chain: **Container JSON logs** → **CRI Parser** → **Traefik Parser** → **Security Analysis**

#### Step 2.2: Configure CrowdSec Enrollment

```bash
kubectl create secret generic --namespace crowdsec crowdsec-secrets \
  --from-literal=enroll_key="$CROWDSEC_ENROLL_KEY"
```

Enrollment connects our local CrowdSec instance to the global threat intelligence network, enabling community-driven security intelligence while maintaining local decision autonomy. This provides access to shared attack patterns without exposing local traffic data.

#### Step 2.3: Verify CrowdSec Deployment

```bash
kubectl get pods -n crowdsec
kubectl logs -n crowdsec -l k8s-app=crowdsec -f
```

**Expected Behavior**: CrowdSec pods should reach Running state and establish connection to CrowdSec Console.

### Phase 3: Certificate Management Infrastructure

Certificate management ensures proper TLS handling throughout our architecture. While Cloudflare Tunnel provides encryption in transit, internal services still need valid certificates for end-to-end security and service mesh communication.

#### Step 3.1: Deploy cert-manager

```bash
kubectl kustomize --enable-helm ./kubernetes/cert-manager | kubectl apply -f -
```

Cert-manager automates certificate lifecycle management, handling issuance, renewal, and rotation. This ensures our services maintain valid certificates without manual intervention.

#### Step 3.2: Verify cert-manager Installation

```bash
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
kubectl get customresourcedefinitions | grep cert-manager
```

**Expected Output**: All cert-manager pods should be running, and CRDs should be successfully installed.

### Phase 4: Cloudflare Tunnel Infrastructure

The Cloudflare Operator provides Kubernetes-native tunnel management, enabling declarative configuration through standard Kubernetes resources. This integration allows tunnel lifecycle management through GitOps workflows and ensures consistent, reproducible deployments.

#### Step 4.1: Deploy Cloudflare Operator

```bash
kubectl apply -k ./kubernetes/cloudflare-operator
kubectl create secret generic cloudflare-secrets \
  --namespace cloudflare-operator-system \
  --from-literal CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="$CLOUDFLARE_OPERATOR_API_TOKEN"
```

#### Step 4.2: Create Cloudflare Tunnel

```bash
envsubst < ./kubernetes/cloudflare-operator/cluster-tunnel.yaml.tpl | \
  kubectl apply -f - --namespace cloudflare-operator-system
```

This establishes the secure, encrypted communication channel between Cloudflare's edge network and our local cluster. The tunnel provides persistent connectivity with automatic reconnection, DNS record management, and support for multiple protocols.

#### Step 4.3: Configure Tunnel Service Binding

```bash
envsubst < ./kubernetes/cloudflare-operator/tunnel-binding-to-traefik.yaml.tpl | \
  kubectl apply -f - --namespace cloudflare-operator-system
```

The tunnel binding configuration determines how external requests route to internal services. This enables selective exposure of services while maintaining security boundaries and proper traffic flow control.

#### Step 4.4: Verify Tunnel Establishment

```bash
kubectl get clustertunnel -n cloudflare-operator-system
kubectl get pods -n cloudflare-operator-system
```

**Expected Behavior**: ClusterTunnel resource should show as Ready, and cloudflared pods should be running and connected.

### Phase 5: Edge Security Integration

This phase connects our local CrowdSec intelligence with Cloudflare's edge infrastructure, creating a distributed security enforcement system. The bouncer architecture ensures that security decisions made locally are executed at the global edge, blocking threats before they reach our homelab.

#### Step 5.1: Generate CrowdSec Bouncer API Key

```bash
kubectl exec --namespace crowdsec -it \
  $(kubectl get pods --namespace crowdsec -l type=lapi -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") \
  -- cscli bouncers add cloudflare-tunnel-bouncer --key cloudflare-worker-bouncer
```

The bouncer API key enables secure, authenticated communication between the Cloudflare Worker and our local CrowdSec LAPI. This key is scoped specifically to bouncer operations with HMAC authentication and comprehensive audit logging.

#### Step 5.2: Deploy CrowdSec Cloudflare Bouncer

```bash
kubectl apply -k ./kubernetes/cloudflare-cs-bouncer
```

The bouncer acts as a bridge between our local CrowdSec instance and Cloudflare's edge infrastructure, automatically deploying Workers and synchronizing security rules. This component manages the entire Worker lifecycle and ensures continuous security policy updates.

#### Step 5.3: Configure Bouncer Settings

```bash
envsubst < ./kubernetes/cloudflare-cs-bouncer/bouncer-config.yaml.tpl | \
  kubectl create secret generic crowdsec-bouncer-config \
  --namespace cloudflare-cs-bouncer --from-file=config.yaml=/dev/stdin
```

Bouncer configuration defines protection routes, threat response actions, and API connectivity. The configuration protects our wildcard domain with CAPTCHA challenges for suspicious traffic, ban actions for confirmed threats, and automatic Turnstile secret rotation for enhanced security.

#### Step 5.4: Verify Bouncer Deployment

```bash
kubectl get pods -n cloudflare-cs-bouncer
kubectl logs -n cloudflare-cs-bouncer -l app.kubernetes.io/component=bouncer -f
```

**Expected Behavior**: Bouncer should successfully deploy Cloudflare Worker and establish synchronization with local CrowdSec LAPI.

### Phase 6: Application Service Deployment

We deploy a simple Hello World application to validate the complete traffic flow through our security architecture. This controlled test environment allows us to verify end-to-end functionality without exposing production services.

#### Step 6.1: Deploy Hello World Test Application

```bash
kubectl kustomize --enable-helm ./kubernetes/hello-world | \
  sed "s/helloworld.local/hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN/g" | \
  kubectl apply -f -
```

The Hello World service provides a simple HTTP endpoint accessible through our complete security stack. This creates the target service that external traffic will reach after passing through Cloudflare's edge protection, CrowdSec filtering, and tunnel routing.

#### Step 6.2: Verify Application Deployment

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=helloworld
kubectl get service helloworld
kubectl get ingress helloworld
```

**Expected Output**: Hello World pod running, service accessible internally, ingress configured for external access.

### Phase 7: End-to-End Validation

Final validation ensures all components work together correctly, from external request reception through edge processing to internal service delivery.

#### Step 7.1: Test External Connectivity

```bash
# Test basic connectivity
curl -I https://hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN

# Test with verbose headers
curl -v https://hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN
```

Successful connectivity should show HTTP 200 responses with Cloudflare processing headers and content delivered from the Hello World application, confirming the complete traffic flow.

#### Step 7.2: Verify Security Layer Activation

```bash
# Check CrowdSec decision logs
kubectl logs -n crowdsec -l k8s-app=crowdsec | grep -i decision

# Check bouncer synchronization
kubectl logs -n cloudflare-cs-bouncer -l app.kubernetes.io/component=bouncer | grep -i sync
```

Logs should demonstrate traffic analysis and decision synchronization between CrowdSec and the Cloudflare Worker, confirming that security intelligence is flowing correctly through the system.

## Testing & Validation

### Security Validation Tests

#### Test 1: Legitimate Traffic Flow

**Objective**: Verify that normal user traffic flows correctly through all security layers.

```bash
# Test from different geographic locations using curl
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{time_total}s\n" \
    https://hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN
  sleep 2
done
```

**Expected Results**:

* All requests return HTTP 200
* Response times consistent and reasonable
* No CAPTCHA challenges for normal request patterns

#### Test 2: Rapid Request Pattern (Rate Limiting Test)

**Objective**: Validate that rapid request patterns trigger appropriate security responses.

```bash
# Generate rapid requests to trigger rate limiting
for i in {1..50}; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
    https://hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN &
done
wait
```

**Expected Results**:

* Initial requests succeed (HTTP 200)
* Subsequent requests trigger CAPTCHA (HTTP 429 or redirect)
* CrowdSec logs show decision generation

#### Test 3: Malicious Request Simulation

**Objective**: Test response to common attack patterns.

```bash
# SQL injection attempt
curl -v "https://hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN/?id=1' OR '1'='1"

# XSS attempt
curl -v "https://hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN/?search=<script>alert('xss')</script>"

# Directory traversal attempt
curl -v "https://hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN/../../../etc/passwd"
```

**Expected Results**:

* Malicious requests should be blocked or challenged
* CrowdSec should generate appropriate decisions
* Worker should enforce blocking actions

### Architecture Validation Tests

#### Test 4: Origin IP Protection

**Objective**: Verify that the homelab's public IP address is not exposed.

```bash
# DNS lookup should point to Cloudflare
dig hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN

# Trace route should terminate at Cloudflare edge
traceroute hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN
```

**Expected Results**:

* DNS resolves to Cloudflare IP addresses
* No exposure of homelab public IP in routing

#### Test 5: Certificate Validation

**Objective**: Ensure proper TLS certificate handling throughout the chain.

```bash
# Check certificate chain
openssl s_client -connect hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN:443 \
  -showcerts </dev/null

# Validate certificate subject and issuer
curl -vI https://hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN 2>&1 | \
  grep -E "(subject:|issuer:)"
```

**Expected Results**:

* Valid certificate chain from trusted CA
* Proper subject alternative names
* No certificate warnings or errors

### Component Integration Tests

#### Test 6: CrowdSec Decision Propagation

**Objective**: Validate that CrowdSec decisions properly propagate to Cloudflare Worker.

```bash
# Manually ban an IP through CrowdSec
kubectl exec -n crowdsec -it \
  $(kubectl get pods -n crowdsec -l type=lapi -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") \
  -- cscli decisions add --ip 192.0.2.1 --duration 1h --reason "test-ban"

# Check if decision appears in bouncer logs
kubectl logs -n cloudflare-cs-bouncer | grep 192.0.2.1

# Test access from banned IP (simulated)
# Note: This requires testing from the banned IP or using a proxy
```

**Expected Results**:

* Decision successfully created in CrowdSec
* Bouncer logs show decision synchronization
* Access from banned IP is blocked at Cloudflare edge

#### Test 7: Tunnel Resilience

**Objective**: Test tunnel recovery after connection interruption.

```bash
# Restart cloudflared pods
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n cloudflare-operator-system

# Monitor tunnel reconnection
kubectl logs -n cloudflare-operator-system -f

# Test connectivity during and after restart
while true; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} " \
    https://hello.poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec.$CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_DOMAIN
  sleep 5
done
```

**Expected Results**:

* Tunnel automatically reconnects after pod restart
* Brief interruption in connectivity during restart
* Full service restoration expected after reconnection

| **Geographic Distribution** | Global edge network      | Single point (home ISP)    |

### Security Assessment

#### Security Strengths

* **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers from edge to application
* **Community Intelligence**: Real-time threat intelligence from CrowdSec network
* **Edge Filtering**: Malicious traffic blocked before reaching homelab infrastructure
* **Encrypted Transport**: End-to-end encryption through tunnel and internal network
* **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust based on network location

#### Security Considerations

* **Single Point of Failure**: Cloudflare infrastructure dependency
* **Third-Party Trust**: Reliance on Cloudflare's security practices
* **Configuration Drift**: Multiple configuration points requiring synchronization
* **API Key Management**: Several high-privilege API keys requiring secure storage

## Production Considerations

For homelab deployment, key considerations:

* **Secret Management**: Integrate with OpenBao/Vault instead of manual secrets
* **GitOps**: Convert to ArgoCD ApplicationSet for automated deployment
* **API Key Security**: Store Cloudflare tokens securely, rotate quarterly
* **Worker Route Management**: Current bouncer config hardcodes protected routes. For multi-cluster homelab, manage Cloudflare Worker routes via Crossplane to allow each cluster autonomous service exposure without bouncer redeployment

## Cleanup Procedures

### Environment Cleanup

When POC testing is complete, follow these steps to clean up resources:

#### Step 1: Remove Cloudflare Resources

```bash
# Remove bouncer (will clean up Cloudflare Worker)
kubectl delete ns cloudflare-cs-bouncer

# Remove tunnel configuration
kubectl delete clustertunnel main-tunnel -n cloudflare-operator-system
```

**Purpose**: Ensures all Cloudflare-managed resources are properly deleted to avoid ongoing charges.

#### Step 2: Destroy Local Cluster

```bash
# Delete the entire test cluster
k3d cluster delete poc-cloudflare-tunnel-with-crowdsec
```

**Purpose**: Complete cleanup of local development environment.

#### Step 3: Verify Cloudflare Cleanup

1. **Cloudflare Dashboard**: Verify tunnel is deleted from Zero Trust → Access → Tunnels
2. **DNS Records**: Confirm automatic DNS records are removed
3. **Worker Scripts**: Verify CrowdSec worker is deleted from Workers & Pages

> \[!NOTE]\
> This POC validates Option 5 from ADR-006 and provides the technical foundation for final architectural decision-making. The implementation demonstrates production viability while identifying specific considerations for full deployment.
