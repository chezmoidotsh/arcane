# Homelab External Services Access Strategy: Zero-Trust Service Exposure

## Context and Problem Statement

### Homelab Infrastructure Context

The homelab infrastructure consists of multiple clusters (`amiya.akn`, `lungmen.akn`, `maison`) hosting various services that require external access. Currently, all services are only accessible within the Tailscale mesh network, limiting external user access, integrations, and use cases.

### The External Access Challenge

External users, applications, and integrations must access homelab services without requiring VPN access. This architectural decision impacts the entire homelab ecosystem, enabling:

* **Authentication Services**: External user authentication and OIDC flows (Authelia)
* **Administrative Interfaces**: Remote management of homelab infrastructure
* **Application Services**: Selective exposure of self-hosted applications
* **API Endpoints**: Third-party integrations and webhooks
* **Monitoring & Observability**: External access to dashboards and alerting systems

### Service Categorization Framework

Different service types require different exposure patterns and security considerations:

1. **Authentication Services** (High Security): SSO, OIDC providers, user directories
2. **Administrative Services** (Restricted Access): Management interfaces, configuration tools
3. **Application Services** (User-Facing): Self-hosted applications, content delivery
4. **Integration Services** (API-First): Webhooks, API endpoints, automation triggers

### Strategic Requirements

* **Security First**: Avoid third-party TLS termination (no MITM by provider)
* **Privacy Protection**: Hide the home public IP address from external exposure
* **Abuse Mitigation**: Implement robust protection against automated abuse (bots, brute-force, DoS)
* **Zero-Trust Principles**: Maintain security even with internet-facing exposure
* **Service-Specific Policies**: Different protection levels based on service criticality and exposure requirements

## Decision Drivers

### Security Requirements

* **End-to-End Encryption**: Preserve TLS termination at the homelab edge without third-party MITM
* **Zero-Trust Principles**: Implement defense-in-depth even for internet-facing services
* **Service-Specific Protection**: Tailored security policies based on service criticality and exposure patterns
* **Abuse Protection**: Comprehensive rate limiting and protection against automated attacks

### Operational Requirements

* **Homelab Compatibility**: Simple, maintainable approach suitable for solo operator
* **Infrastructure Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Envoy Gateway, cert-manager, and Kubernetes patterns
* **Cost Effectiveness**: Minimize recurring costs and operational complexity
* **Scalability**: Solution must support multiple services with varying exposure requirements

### Architectural Constraints

* **Privacy First**: Hide home public IP address from external exposure
* **Self-Hosting Principles**: Maintain control over critical infrastructure components
* **Existing Investment**: Leverage current Envoy Gateway, cert-manager, and authentication architecture
* **Service Diversity**: Support different service types (authentication, admin, application, API) with appropriate protection levels

## Considered Options

1. **Cloudflare Tunnel (+ WAF/Access)**: Original Cloudflare Tunnel option with WAF capabilities
2. **Tailscale Funnel (+ gateway/app-side protections)**: Zero-trust approach with Tailscale
3. **Dedicated edge proxy**: Self-hosted cloud VM with Traefik/Envoy Gateway + optional WAF
4. **Cloudflare Tunnel (Proxy L4) + GW with CrowdSec**: Cloudflare L4 proxy with Traefik/Envoy Gateway and CrowdSec
5. **Cloudflare Tunnel (Proxy L4) with CrowdSec Worker + GW**: Cloudflare L4 proxy with CrowdSec worker and Envoy Gateway, most promising option eliminating Traefik dependency

## Decision History

**Original Decision (2025-08-09)**: "Tailscale Funnel + Hybrid Gateway Strategy (Traefik + CrowdSec â†’ Envoy Gateway)" providing immediate mature anti-bot protection with planned migration to unified Envoy Gateway architecture for all external homelab service exposure.

**First Update (2025-08-10)**: After discovering Tailscale Funnel's limitation to HTTP/HTTPS traffic and challenges with WAF integration, consideration shifted to "Cloudflare Tunnel Proxy L4 + GW protection" for comprehensive protocol support.

**Current Status (2025-08-10)**: The fifth option "Cloudflare Tunnel (Proxy L4) with CrowdSec Worker + GW" has emerged as most promising due to eliminating Traefik dependency, but requires further proof-of-concept testing before final decision.

## Decision Outcome

**Status**: Proof of concept in progress for Option 5 (Cloudflare Tunnel with CrowdSec Worker + GW)

**No final decision has been made.** Currently evaluating the most promising approach that would eliminate Traefik dependency while providing comprehensive protocol support and robust security capabilities.

The final architecture will be selected based on POC results.

### Key Implementation Components

**Current Implementation Components**:

* **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Provides secure L4 proxying for both HTTP and TCP traffic (without WAF capabilities)
* **CrowdSec Cloudflare Integration**: Potential integration via Cloudflare Bouncer or Cloudflare Worker Bouncer to add security capabilities
* **Client-side cloudflared**: Required for accessing TCP services through the tunnel
* **DNS-01 Certificates**: Automated certificate management without domain validation exposure

**Service-Specific Protection Patterns**:

* **Authentication Services** (Initial use case: Authelia): Enhanced regulation with strict rate limiting and multi-layer abuse protection
* **Administrative Services**: No external exposure; internal access via Tailscale mesh
* **Application Services**: Balanced protection suitable for user-facing applications with reasonable rate limits
* **Integration Services**: API-focused protection with token-based authentication and endpoint-specific policies

**Original Migration Plan (Historical)**:

* ~~cs-envoy-bouncer reaches production maturity (documentation, stable releases)~~
* ~~Community adoption and validation~~
* ~~Feature parity with Traefik CrowdSec plugin~~

This hybrid approach enables immediate deployment with mature anti-bot protection while preserving the path to unified Envoy Gateway architecture when the ecosystem matures.

  * Vendor lock-in; DNS delegation to Cloudflare typically required

## Implementation Strategy

**NOTE: Implementation strategy pending proof of concept results for Option 5**

The specific implementation strategy will be defined after the proof of concept for Option 5 (Cloudflare Tunnel with CrowdSec Worker + GW) is completed and evaluated.

### Potential Implementation Components

Depending on the selected approach, implementation may include some of the following components:

* **Cloudflare Tunnel Deployment**: cloudflared daemon in Kubernetes for secure L4 proxying
* **CrowdSec Integration**: Either via Cloudflare Worker/Bouncer or Gateway plugin
* **Client Access Configuration**: For TCP services requiring client-side cloudflared
* **Certificate Management**: Using existing cert-manager DNS-01 automation
* **Protection Layer Configuration**: Based on service type and criticality

### Security Architecture Considerations

**NOTE: Final security architecture pending proof of concept results**

The envisioned security architecture will include multiple protection layers, but specific implementation details will be determined after POC evaluation. Key security components under consideration:

1. **Network Layer**: L4 proxying and IP masking mechanisms
2. **Edge Protection**: Integration options between CrowdSec and selected proxy solution
3. **Gateway Protection**: Community threat intelligence capabilities
4. **Protocol Support**: Both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP protocol handling
5. **Service-Specific Protection**: Authentication regulation and rate limiting
6. **Internal Traffic Handling**: Maintaining separation between external and internal traffic

### Transition Considerations

**NOTE: Transition strategy to be determined after proof of concept**

**Transition Rationale (from Tailscale to Cloudflare)**:

* Tailscale Funnel's limitation to HTTP/HTTPS traffic only (no raw TCP support)
