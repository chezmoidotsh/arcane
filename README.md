## ℹ️ About

Welcome to the repository for my personal homelab infrastructure. This monorepo contains all the code and configurations for managing
my homelab, including various services and tools.
*This repository will probably never be finished, as I'll always be adding new services or tools to my homelab, where I'd like to make
improvements on them.*

> \[!NOTE]
> Why the name Arcane? For two reasons:
>
> 1. Because of the very definition of "arcane": "a mysterious operation whose secrets should only be known to the initiated".
>    I find this definition perfectly represents this project and its content, as nobody really understands it 😅.
> 2. As a tribute to the [Arcane](https://www.arcane.com/) animated series, which left a lasting impression on me.

> \[!CAUTION]
> This repository is a work in progress and currently in a proof of concept phase to find the way I want to manage this homelab.
> It is not yet ready to be reused or forked.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

> \[!NOTE]
> I'm currently trying to find a way to manage my homelab infrastructure as code. This roadmap is a work in progress and
> will be updated as I find new ways to improve my homelab. All the history of my choices and changes will be documented
> in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

* \[X] ~~Try using `docker-compose` and scripts to manage all containers in the homelab (See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md#stone-age-2023-2024---a0))~~

* \[X] ~~Try using `Pulumi` to manage the infrastructure (See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md#bronze-age-2024-2024---a1))~~

* [x] ~~Try using `Helm` to manage the Kubernetes applications and `Terraform` to manage the infrastructure (See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md#iron-age-2024-2024---a2))~~

* [ ] **Secure Internet Access**: Ensure the homelab is accessible from the internet securely.

* [ ] **Project Endfield**: Implement the AI stack.

* [ ] **Energy Efficiency**: Reduce energy consumption (KEDA -> scaling to 0, start/stop servers at night).

* [ ] **Resilience & DRP**: Rework resilience and Disaster Recovery Plan (especially recovery of critical elements like personal documents).
