<!--
AI GUIDANCE: This template is optimized for AI agents proposing infrastructure enhancements.

KEY PRINCIPLES:
1. Clearly articulate the problem being solved, not just the solution
2. Provide comprehensive technical details - this guides implementation
3. Consider architecture impact and integration points
4. Document benefits and trade-offs objectively
5. Replace <scope> with actual scope (project:amiya.akn, catalog:crossplane, etc.)

ENHANCEMENT TYPES:
- Performance optimization: Improving speed, resource usage, or efficiency
- Security hardening: Adding security controls or reducing attack surface
- Maintainability: Simplifying configuration, improving observability
- Feature addition: New capabilities that enhance existing systems
- Infrastructure improvement: Upgrading or modernizing infrastructure components

TECHNICAL CONTEXT:
- GitOps via ArgoCD for declarative deployments
- Talos Linux for Kubernetes distribution
- Pocket-Id for SSO/OIDC authentication
- OpenBao for secrets management
- Cilium for network policies and microsegmentation
- Envoy Gateway for ingress and routing
- Cloudflare Tunnel for secure public exposure
- Longhorn for persistent storage
- CloudNative-PG for PostgreSQL databases

IMPORTANT: Be specific about implementation approach - vague proposals are hard to execute.
